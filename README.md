# badass-cookies

A cookie jar inspired by David Goggins. Write down your daily wins (cookies) in this Telegram chatbot. When you're feeling down, ask for a cookie. Feel pumped. Get back to being awesome and new wins!

When you see a cookie, you can ask for it to be shown more/less frequently.

Currently the bot is only text. I'm working on adding image support. A web front end should also be available this summer.

You can visit the website at https://thetinywins.carrd.co/

## The bot is currently non-functional since Heroku stopped offering free plans. I'm working on migrating it to another backend. Expect it to work again by June.

#### For the nerds, technology used:
- npm (used 8.5.2)
- nodejs (used v16.14.0)
- supabase-js
- telegraf
